Create your custom 404 Page as a normal WordPress Page using the full power of WordPress. You can use a Custom Page Template or Custom Fields, you can set a Featured Image - everything like on every other Page. Then go to 'Settings' -> '404 Error Page' from your WordPress Dashbord and select the created Page as your 404 error page. That's it!

= Why you should choose this plugin =

* Different from other similar plugins the 404page plugin **does not create redirects**. That’s **quite important** because a correct code 404 is delivered which tells search engines that the page does not exist and has to be removed from the index. A redirect would result in a HTTP code 301 or 302 and the URL would remain in the search index.
* Different from other similar plugins the 404page plugin **does not create additional server requests**. It makes use of the WordPress 404 handling.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Are there any requirements? =

To enable the WordPress 404 error handling you have to set the Permalink Structure ('Settings' -> 'Permalinks') to anything else but 'Default'. Otherwise 404 errors are handled by the webserver and not by WordPress.

= Are 404 errors redirected? =

No, there is no redirection! The chosen page is delivered as a 'real' 404 error page. This results in a HTTP 404 code and not in 301 or 302, which is important for Search Engines to tell them, that the page does not exist and should be deleted from the index.
